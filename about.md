<p class=""> Hey there! My name is Nikhil. Graduated in May 2017 from
  IIT Roorkee. I write software for food, fun and to solve interesting
  problems. Currently working with
  <a href="https://www.cashfree.com/" target="_blank"> Cashfree </a>
  as a Product Engineer in Bengaluru, India.  </p>

<p class=""> If you're in Bengaluru and in for a beer or coffee,
  <a href="/contact"> let me know </a>. I like listening people's story,
  talking and reading about science, technology, business and life.</p>
