In "Corporate World" there is a lot of focus on documenting things,
which I didn't used to do much in college. And doing it made me
realize it's importance. While working on any project, now I'm in a
habit of writing things down, what worked, what didn't, everything,
which most of the time involve troubleshooting.

And looking back last 2-3 year, I've spent countless hours on
installing and fixing things, sometimes even on repeated stuff and
other than StackOverflow, blogs of other people helped me more than
anything. Because of these reasons I've started to write about
breaking and fixing things publicly. Here is the list of the posts on
same:

- [When Your Sudo and Pacman
  Breaks](/2018/01/07/when-your-sudo-and-pacman-breaks)
- [No support for OPTIONS
  request](/2018/03/23/what-is-that-options-request-before-post-and-cross-origin-resource-sharing)
